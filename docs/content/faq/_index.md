## Introduction 

In command-line examples on this page, commands to be typed to the shell begin with a dollar sign “$”. Lines that do not begin with “$” show command output.

The text uses you@example.com as a stand-in for your user name. If you run one of these commands, substitute your own name for that one.

```bash
$ run this
```

The examples are Unix-oriented but it should be easy to adapt them to a Windows environment.

## What are the goals of the project?
We have a simple plan, use less battery and gain more wireless distance. Battery life, is honestly one of our main drivers. If we can make our sensor last weeks, or a month, or more between charging we will have succeeded. The unit must also provide usable, readable data. All of the complicated mathematics and code must be executed flawlessly while being simple to use.

## Can I use find2 on my phone?



## Can I access find2 from a web browser?


## How does find2 handle security?


## Can I design an app for find2?
=======
## Can I use de0gee on my phone?
Yes, Android and Apple will be supported, not too sure anyone uses a Microsoft phone?


## Can I access de0gee from a web browser?
Yes


## How does de0gee handle security?
Pretty poorly to start. We have some options, but the real challenge is to make it user friendly while protecting your home network. We have an on-board hardware encryption for our Silicon Labs EFR32, we think that will solve the wireless data encryption, and the rest of the security will be implemented at the back end. But we are open to suggestions....


## Can I design an app for de0gee?
Please do, let us know how we can help. We want to serve people with disabilities, service dogs and indoor navigation for the visually impaired. A dog collar seemed like a good place to start and hopefully implement a Bluetooth 5 Mesh function, but that is not ready today.
