Have you ever wanted to...

- do home automation without motion sensors?
- track your phone or laptop *indoors* without GPS?
- monitor the whereabouts and trajectories of cell phones?

FIND stands for the **Framework for Internal Navigation and Discovery**, which is an attempt implement a solution to these questions. This version, FIND3, is v3.X of FIND (the latest version).
